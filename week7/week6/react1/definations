1>Define SPA and its benefits
SPA (Single-Page Application) is a type of web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without reloading the entire page.
Benefits:
Faster navigation
Improved user experience
Reduced server load
Smooth transitions without full-page refresh

2. Define React and Identify Its Working
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially SPAs.
How it works:
Uses a component-based architecture
Renders UI using a virtual DOM
Updates only the changed elements in the DOM, improving performance

3. Differences Between SPA and MPA
Feature	SPA (Single-Page App)	MPA (Multi-Page App)
Page Loads	Loads once, updates dynamically	Loads a new page on each click
Speed	Faster interactions	Slower due to reloads
SEO	Harder to optimize	Easier for SEO
Example	Gmail, Facebook	Amazon, eBay

4. Pros & Cons of Single-Page Applications
Pros:
Fast and responsive
Reusable components
Better user experience
Cons:
SEO is harder
Initial load may be slow
Requires JavaScript to function properly

5. Explain About React
React is used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces using:
Components (reusable UI pieces)
JSX (JavaScript + HTML syntax)
Virtual DOM for performance
State and Props to manage data flow

6. Define Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript object that mimics the real DOM. React uses it to:
Track changes
Compare old vs new virtual DOM (diffing)
Update only the changed parts in the real DOM (reconciliation)

7. Features of React
Component-based architecture
JSX for writing HTML in JS
Virtual DOM for faster updates
One-way data binding
React Hooks (like useState, useEffect)
Large ecosystem (React Router, Redux, etc.)
